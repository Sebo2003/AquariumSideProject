                            You can have all the prettiest fish and corals in the world - if you don't have the tools 
                            to maintain them, they're not going to last long. However, doing a bit of research 
                            online may become quickly overwhelming, so I've categorized equipment into three categories: 
                            “Essentia”, which is exactly as it sounds, “Nonessential”, which is equipment you don't 
                            technically need but would be significantly worse off without, and “luxury”, which are 
                            pieces of equipment you genuinely don't need at all, and are just that - luxuries!
                            It may be a little confusing why some things are considered essential and others are 
                            "nonessential", but I'm relying upon my years of experience in the hobby on deciding
                            what should go where. I hope you can take my word on it!

                            ...isn't this self-explanatory? Absolutley! However - what specific kind of tank you purchase
                            for your new soon-to-be reef tank will create a million of cascading domino effects that will
                            haunt you donw the line! For instance - got a good deal on craiglist but never bothered to
                            check for cracks before you set up your system? Hope you're willing to take a chance on a potential
                            flood!

                        <p>
                            In addition, as you might've noticed in the Fish, Corals, and Invertebrates pages of this site,
                            some animals need minimum tank sizes in order to thrive, as certain animals will need certain
                            densities of any given chemical or mineral.

                        <p>
                            Despite your intuition - the bigger the tank, the easier it is to keep! This is true for freshwater,
                            but is essentially true for saltwater, due to the whole desnity thing I mentioned earlier (in this
                            instance, the larger the tank, the more time you have to react to high levels of toxins in your
                            tank). This isn't even considering things to consider such as weight, stand, location, flooring,
                            and so on!

                        <p>
                            The sump is like a mini second aqaurium, or at least it can be. I use the second space in my sump to house
                            chaetomorpha algae, which creates a safe zone for amphipods, copepods, and other microgranims that would
                            otherwise be eaten in the display tank. Here's a more detailed description:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In reef keeping, a sump refers to an auxiliary or secondary tank that is connected to the main display aquarium. 
                            It is typically located below the main tank, either inside the stand or in a separate compartment. The sump houses various 
                            filtration equipment, such as protein skimmers, mechanical filters, chemical media reactors, and refugiums. These 
                            components help remove waste, excess nutrients, and impurities from the water, promoting better water quality and 
                            overall aquarium health.
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            Once in the sump, the water undergoes filtration processes and can be further customized to meet specific needs. 
                            It is then pumped back into the main tank using a return pump. This circulation helps maintain water movement, 
                            oxygenation, and nutrient distribution within the aquarium. Advantages of using a sump in reef keeping include increased water 
                            volume, improved stability, expanded filtration options, and easier maintenance. It provides additional 
                            space for equipment, reduces clutter in the main tank, and allows for customization based on the specific 
                            requirements of the reef ecosystem.

                            It may seem suprising to see heaters listed as "essential", but I assure you - they are! Temperature
                            is one of the most important parameters in your entire system, as if it ever gets too low for too 
                            long - everything dies! These are tropical animals, after all! Heaters are especially important for 
                            the following reasons:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            Many reef organisms, such as corals and certain fish species, have specific temperature requirements for proper biological 
                            functions. These include metabolism, growth, reproduction, and overall health. A stable temperature within the recommended 
                            range promotes optimal biological processes and reduces the risk of stress-related issues.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            In reef tanks, a variety of fish, invertebrates, and corals are often combined. Different species have different temperature preferences and 
                            requirements. A water heater allows you to set and maintain a temperature that accommodates the needs of various organisms, 
                            ensuring compatibility and reducing stress among tank inhabitants. It's important to select an appropriately sized and reliable water heater 
                            for your reef tank, and regularly monitor the water temperature to ensure it remains within the optimal range for the specific organisms you keep.

                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            In a reef tank, a return pump is a vital component of the aquarium's circulation system. Its primary function is 
                            to move water from the sump or filtration system back into the main display tank. Here's how a return 
                            pump works and why it is important:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            The return pump creates water movement and circulation within the aquarium. This helps distribute heat, 
                            oxygen, and nutrients evenly throughout the tank, benefiting the overall health of the reef ecosystem. 
                            Adequate water flow is crucial for corals, fish, and other organisms to thrive. The return pump also plays a key role in the 
                            filtration process. After the water passes through various filtration equipment in the sump, the return pump 
                            pumps the filtered water back into the display tank. It ensures that the water is continuously filtered, 
                            removing waste, debris, and excess nutrients.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Return pumps offer adjustable flow rates, allowing aquarists to customize the water movement according to the 
                            specific needs of their reef tank. Different organisms may require varying flow patterns, and the return pump 
                            provides the flexibility to create the desired water circulation within the aquarium. Personally, I always
                            attatch a GPH (Gallons per Hour) meter on my plumbing so I can always see how well the motor in the pump

                        <p>
                            How can you ever hope to have proper control over your system if you don't even understand what's going
                            on with the water? Testing kits are essential for reef tanks as they allow aquarists to monitor and maintain 
                            crucial water parameters necessary for the health and well-being of the reef ecosystem. 
                            Here's why testing kits are required:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            Testing kits aid in monitoring water parameters that directly impact coral health, such as pH, calcium, 
                            alkalinity, and magnesium. Corals are sensitive to changes in these parameters, and deviations from 
                            the ideal range can lead to stress, tissue recession, bleaching, or compromised coloration. Regular 
                            testing enables aquarists to make adjustments and ensure stable conditions for the well-being of corals. 
                            Also, if issues arise within the reef tank, testing kits allow aquarists to narrow down the potential 
                            causes by analyzing water parameters. By comparing test results against recommended ranges and known 
                            requirements of the organisms, aquarists can identify imbalances, pollution sources, or deficiencies 
                            and take appropriate corrective actions.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            There's lost of different kits out there - but for my money - you want to go with Red Sea. They
                            have the highest-quality test kits for the most reasonable price, especially their Ammonia /
                            Nitrite / Nitrate test kit. Most kits use titration or color-matching as their test, but I've 
                            always disliked these tests as they're difficult to derive results from (is this water light blue 
                            or light light blue?). I always prefer something like a spectrometer or colorimeter.

                            Refractometer
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            A refractometer is a device that is used to simply figure out how saline your water is. This is a simple
                            and inexpensive tool that every hobbyist should have, and in my opinion, is easier to gauge than a 
                            hydrometer, which also measures salinity. Here's how a refractometer works:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            A refractometer relies on the principle of refraction, which is the bending of light as it passes through 
                            different substances. When light travels from one medium (such as air) to another medium (such as water), 
                            it changes direction due to the difference in the refractive indices of the two media. A refractometer 
                            consists of a prism and a scale. The prism is made of a material with a known refractive index, 
                            typically glass or plastic. It has a flat surface that comes in contact with the liquid being tested.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            As the light passes through the liquid, the degree of refraction is determined by the 
                            liquid's specific gravity or salinity. The refracted light forms a distinct line or boundary 
                            between the illuminated and dark areas on the scale within the refractometer. The user looks 
                            through an eyepiece or viewing window on the refractometer and aligns the scale boundary with a 
                            reference line or measurement marker. The corresponding value on the scale indicates the 
                            specific gravity or salinity of the liquid being tested. The standard specific gravity you
                            want to shoot for in a tank is 1.024-1.025.

                        <p>
                            A protein skimmer, also known as a foam fractionator, is a device commonly used in marine and reef aquariums 
                            to remove organic compounds and other impurities from the water. It plays a crucial role in maintaining water 
                            quality and creating a healthy environment for the aquatic inhabitants.
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            The primary function of a protein skimmer is to remove dissolved organic compounds, such as proteins, 
                            amino acids, and other organic molecules, before they break down and release harmful substances into the 
                            aquarium water. These compounds can come from various sources, including fish waste, uneaten food, and 
                            decaying organic matter. If left unchecked, they can lead to the accumulation of nitrates, phosphates, and 
                            other pollutants, which can negatively impact water quality and the overall health of the aquarium.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The foam, containing the organic compounds, rises to the top of the protein skimmer and collects in a 
                            collection cup. The collection cup is periodically emptied, removing the accumulated waste from the system. 
                            The cleaned water is returned to the aquarium, resulting in improved water quality. Skimmers actually mimic
                            the phenomenon of sea foam collceting on the shores of beaches, which I find fascinating. For all our
                            advances - humans stil seek to replicate what nature does better.

                            Display lights aren't essential? Well, technically, no! If you're running a FOWLR tank (Fish Only 
                            With Live Rock), you don't need lights! Obviously, its easier to see the inside of your tank
                            with lights, but fish's circadian rythmns don't rely on them, sunlight eminating into the room
                            is enough (and yes, fish can see you through the glass!)

                            For corals, its a different story. Mostly any coral you're going to buy is going to be photosynthetic,
                            in which case if you want to keep them alive, lights are no longer optional. There are dozens of
                            retailers to choose from, with LEDs and photosynthetic lights, it can become easy to get lost in 
                            the hype (LEDs are fine for LPS and softies by the way).
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            For optimal coral growth, you should run a lot of blue light with some red thrown in, as well as some 
                            white to make the tank more lit for easier vewing. Such specific parameters don't matter if your
                            lights are low quality however, so spend your time as you see fit.

                        <p>
                            Refugium lights are specialized lights used in a refugium, which is a separate compartment or area within a reef tank setup. 
                            Refugiums are typically designed to provide a controlled environment for the growth of beneficial 
                            microorganisms, macroalgae, and other organisms that contribute to the overall health of the aquarium.
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            Refugium lights are typically designed to emit light in the blue spectrum, as this spectrum promotes the growth 
                            of photosynthetic organisms such as macroalgae. Blue light with a wavelength of around 450-470 nanometers is 
                            often favored, as it closely resembles the light spectrum that these organisms require for photosynthesis.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            More importantly, Refugium lights are typically set on a separate lighting schedule from the main 
                            tank to provide a consistent photoperiod for the refugium inhabitants. A common practice is to set 
                            the refugium lights to operate on a reverse lighting schedule, meaning they are on when the main 
                            tank lights are off. This approach helps balance the pH and oxygen levels within the overall system.

                            Reverse osmosis deionization (RODI) is a water purification process. It combines two separate
                            water treatment methods, reverse osmosis (RO) and deionization (DI), to produce high-quality, 
                            purified water. 
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            Reverse osmosis is the first step in the RODI process. It involves passing water through a 
                            semipermeable membrane under pressure. The membrane has very tiny pores that allow water 
                            molecules to pass through while blocking larger molecules, impurities, and contaminants. 
                            This process effectively removes a wide range of substances, including dissolved solids, 
                            heavy metals, chlorine, pesticides, and other contaminants.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            After the water has gone through the reverse osmosis stage, it enters the 
                            deionization phase. Deionization utilizes special resin cartridges that contain 
                            ion exchange resins. These resins attract and bind to the remaining charged particles 
                            in the water, such as ions of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and other minerals. This 
                            removes the remaining impurities and further purifies the water. Alternativley,
                            you can just buy RODI water from the store, but this is more expensive long run.

                            A wavemaker, also known as a powerhead or circulation pump, is a device commonly 
                            used in reef tanks to create water movement and simulate natural wave patterns. 
                            It enhances water circulation and provides several benefits to the overall health 
                            and success of a reef tank. 
                        </p>

                            Wavemakers are designed to generate currents and water flow within the aquarium. They 
                            create gentle to strong wave-like motions, mimicking the natural movement of water in 
                            the ocean. This circulation helps distribute oxygen, nutrients, and dissolved gases 
                            throughout the tank, preventing stagnant areas and promoting the health of corals, 
                            fish, and other organisms. The movement and surface agitation produced by wavemakers 
                            facilitate gas exchange at the water's surface. This increases the oxygen level in the 
                            water, ensuring a well-oxygenated environment for the reef tank inhabitants.

                        <p>
                            Many reef organisms, particularly corals, rely on water movement for their 
                            growth and well-being. Wavemakers provide a dynamic and ever-changing environment, 
                            stimulating corals to extend their polyps, enhancing their nutrient uptake, and 
                            promoting overall growth. It also encourages the development of stronger and more 
                            resilient corals.

                            ATO stands for Auto Top-Off, which is an automated system used in reef tanks to maintain consistent water 
                            levels. ATO systems are designed to replenish evaporated water in the aquarium, ensuring stability 
                            and preventing fluctuations in salinity and other water parameters, such as trace minerals or
                            phosphates.

                        <p>
                            The water in a reef tank naturally evaporates over time due to factors like heat from lighting, 
                            aquarium equipment, and environmental conditions. As water evaporates, it leaves behind dissolved 
                            minerals and impurities, leading to an increase in salinity and potential fluctuations in water 
                            chemistry. ATO systems help counteract this by automatically replenishing the lost water.

                            ATO systems consist of a water level sensor or float switch placed in the aquarium. The sensor detects when the 
                            water level drops below a certain point, typically due to evaporation, and triggers the ATO system to add 
                            RODI water to the tank. The brand I use is called "Tunze", a German brand that is depicted in this 
                            picture. Personally, I reccomend them! Their sensor comes with a small siren that plays the most 
                            ear-piecing sound you ever heard if water levels are ever too high!

                            A UV sterilizer is a device commonly used in reef tanks and other aquarium setups to help control and 
                            reduce the population of harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It utilizes 
                            ultraviolet (UV) light to disinfect the water passing through it.

                        <p>
                            The UV sterilizer consists of a specialized chamber that houses a UV-C light bulb. This bulb emits short-wavelength 
                            UV-C light, typically at a wavelength of 254 nanometers, which is highly effective at destroying or inactivating 
                            various microorganisms.

                        <p>
                            UV Sterilizers are often used in one of two modes: high GPH or low GPH (gallons per hour). Having water
                            move quickly through the sterilizer means more water is treated per hour by volume, but the contact time
                            of the water in the sterilizer is low. This is ideal for targeting algae, which reproduces quickly & is 
                            sterilized easily. Low GPH on the other hand is ideal in targeting parasites - as although a lesser amount
                            of total volume is treated per hour - that water that <strong>is</strong> treated is guaranteed to properly
                            sterilize the parasite - who need more contact time than simple alages.

                            as well as other essential trace elements, in the aquarium water. It utilizes a process called 
                            calcium carbonate dissolution to release these elements into the water.

                            The calcium reactor consists of a chamber or reactor vessel that holds the calcium carbonate media. 
                            The media is usually in the form of small pellets or granules and is composed of materials such 
                            as crushed coral skeletons or aragonite. Then, CO2 gas is injected into the reactor chamber. This 
                            CO2 reacts with water to form carbonic acid (H2CO3). The carbonic acid produced through the CO2 
                            injection lowers the pH of the water in the reactor chamber. This acidic environment initiates 
                            the dissolution process of the calcium carbonate media.

                            It utilizes granular ferric oxide media, which has a high affinity for binding and removing phosphates. However,
                            I run mine with some activated carbon as well to collect more organic debris.

                            A water pump or recirculation system is used to circulate the aquarium water through the reactor chamber. 
                            The water enters the reactor from the aquarium and passes through the GFO media. As the water flows through 
                            the reactor chamber, it comes into contact with the granular ferric oxide media. The media acts as an
                             adsorbent, attracting and binding the phosphate molecules present in the water.

                            Regular monitoring of phosphate levels in the aquarium water is important to determine the 
                            effectiveness of the GFO reactor. Over time, the GFO media will become saturated with phosphate 
                            and lose its effectiveness. Periodic maintenance involves replacing the spent media with fresh GFO 
                            to ensure continued phosphate removal.

                            Automatic Doser
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            Now, I've never actually used an automatic doser myself, but people swear by them, so I can 
                            imagine the convnience they provide. Despite never owning one myself, I do understand the 
                            general gist of how one works and what its used for:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            he automatic doser consists of one or more dosing pumps that are connected to separate containers 
                            or reservoirs containing the desired liquid supplements or additives. Each dosing pump is 
                            programmable and can dispense a specific amount of liquid at set intervals. The dosing pump is equipped 
                            with programmable settings, typically controlled through a digital display or interface. These settings
                             allow the user to define the dosing schedule, including the dosing frequency, duration, and amount of 
                             liquid to be dispensed. Some dosing pumps also offer additional features such as multiple dosing.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            RThe liquid supplements or additives are stored in separate reservoirs or containers, each 
                            connected to a corresponding dosing pump. These reservoirs are filled with the desired supplements, 
                            ensuring a ready and continuous supply for the dosing pump to draw from. Based on the desired requirements 
                            of the reef tank, the user programs the dosing pump to deliver precise amounts of the liquid supplements 
                            at specific times. This can be set according to the needs of the organisms in the tank, ensuring optimal 
                            nutrient levels and maintaining water chemistry stability.

                        <p>
                            A colorimeter is a device used to measure the intensity of light transmitted or absorbed by a solution, 
                            typically in terms of its color. Myself, I rely on pocket-sized versions of these created by a company
                            called Hanna Instruments (which I endorse) that I use to test alkalinity, phosphate, and copper.
                            Here's how one works:
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            The solution to be analyzed is placed in a sample cell or cuvette, which is a small, transparent 
                            container specifically designed for use with a colorimeter. The sample cell is usually made of 
                            glass or plastic and has a standard path length (the distance the light travels through the sample) 
                            to ensure consistency and accuracy. The colorimeter contains a photodetector that measures the intensity of 
                            light transmitted through the sample cell or absorbed by the solution. The photodetector converts the 
                            light energy into an electrical signal, which can be analyzed and quantified.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Prior to analysis, the colorimeter is often calibrated using a blank or reference solution. The blank solution 
                            is typically the solvent or medium used to dissolve the substance being measured. Calibrating the colorimeter 
                            helps account for any background absorbance or scattering effects and ensures accurate measurements.

                        <p>
                            A PAR Meter, as expected, measures the PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) of the water. When I 
                            describe what it is to people, I like to describe it as a multimeter for light in water instead of
                            current in a circuit. I don't rely on one myself since my corals are hardy, but for sensitive
                            SPS corals - you're going to want one.
                        </p>
                        <br />                   
                        <p>
                            A PAR meter consists of a light sensor, often a silicon photodiode or photodiode array, that is 
                            sensitive to the range of wavelengths relevant to photosynthesis. The sensor detects the incoming 
                            light and converts it into an electrical current or voltage proportional to the light intensity.
                            The sensor in a PAR meter is often referred to as a quantum sensor. It measures the number of photons 
                            within the photosynthetically active range that reach the sensor per unit time. The sensor's 
                            sensitivity is calibrated to accurately quantify the amount of photosynthetically active radiation.

                        <p>
                            To measure the light intensity, the PAR meter is held or placed at the desired location within the 
                            target area, such as a reef tank or plant canopy. The sensor is exposed to the ambient light, 
                            and the meter displays the light intensity reading in units of photosynthetic photon flux density 
                            (PPFD), usually expressed in micromoles of photons per square meter per second (μmol/m²/s).
